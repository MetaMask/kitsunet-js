- transmission new tx and blocks
  - nice to have app level validation
    - open transaction and verify 
    - if its valid retransmit
    - if invalid don't retransmit and blacklist the node that transmitted the tx

  - retrieving slices
   - finding peers that provide those slices

### content discovery
